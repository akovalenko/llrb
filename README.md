# Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees (plain C) #

Simple, readable, portable public-domain implementation of
left-leaning red-black trees (with optional linked list for easier
node traversal).

* See https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf for details
  on underlying data structure.

* See header comment in llrb.h for some design notes.

* See example_int for how llrb could be used for Map and Set.

* See example_string for some other useful things (how to design a
  structure to be a member of two independent trees).
